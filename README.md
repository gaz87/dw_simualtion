Excited to share a project I've been working on: an Interactive Dewatering System Simulator! ðŸŒŠðŸ’§

Ever wondered how pumping wells affect groundwater levels around an excavation site? This tool helps visualize just that!

Built with Streamlit, this simulator allows users to:
ðŸ”¹ Model groundwater drawdown in unconfined aquifers.
ðŸ”¹ Interactively set up aquifer conditions and well designs.
ðŸ”¹ Plan well layouts around an excavation.
ðŸ”¹ Instantly see results with 1D profiles and interactive 3D visualizations.
ðŸ”¹ Estimate the time to reach target water levels for construction or environmental projects.

It's a practical application for hydrogeologists, civil engineers, and anyone involved in construction dewatering or groundwater management. The goal is to provide a user-friendly way to understand complex groundwater behavior and make more informed decisions.
